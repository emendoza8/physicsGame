## CIS 376 Simple Physics Game

### Purpose
This is a simple demonstration of working with a game and physics engine to prototype a basic game. Dependencies indclude SDL2 for graphics, Box2D for physics, Lua for scripting, and MathFu for matrices, vectors, tranformations, etc.
The engine and tons of other code/help provided by MR. W @ GVSU. 
This will eventually include all header files need to run but for now is just storing source code and a make file. 

## Demonstration 
### It's Keepy Uppy at it's finest
